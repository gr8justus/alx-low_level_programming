# C Preprocessor

## Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding and working with the C preprocessor. The C
preprocessor is a powerful tool that helps us manipulate the source code before
being passed to the compiler. It allows us to define macros, include header
files, and perform conditional compilation.

## What Are Macros and How to Use Them

Macros are preprocessor directives that allow us to define reusable pieces of
code. Macros are typically defined using the `#define` directive. Here's how to
use them:

```
// Define a simple macro
#define PI 3.14159265359

// Using the macro in code
float circleArea(float radius) {
    return PI * radius * radius;
}
```
Macros are useful for defining constants, inline functions, and other code
snippets you want to reuse throughout your program.

## Most Common Predefined Macros

The C preprocessor provides several predefined macros you can use in your code.
Some of the most common ones include:

```
__FILE__: The name of the current source file.
__LINE__: The current line number in the source file.
__DATE__: The date the source code was compiled.
__TIME__: The time the source code was compiled.
```
## How to Include Guard Your Header Files

Header files are essential for organizing C source code and sharing code between
different parts of your program. To prevent issues with multiple inclusions, we
use include guards. An include guard ensures that a header file is included only
once. Here's how to use include guards:

```
#ifndef MY_HEADER_H
#define MY_HEADER_H

// Header file contents go here

#endif // MY_HEADER_H
```
