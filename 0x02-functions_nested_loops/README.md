Functions, Nested Loops


Project Description

The "Functions, Nested Loops" project is a journey into C programming, where
I'll explore and master fundamental concepts essential for writing efficient and
modular code. This project will serve as a showcase of my progress in the
following areas:

Nested Loops

Description: Understanding and effectively using nested loops to iterate over
multiple dimensions and perform complex tasks.
Highlight: Mastery of nested loops for tackling intricate programming
challenges.

Functions
Description: Exploring the concept of functions in C programming, including
their definition, usage, and calling.
Highlight: Proficiency in structuring code with functions for better
organization and readability.

Function Prototypes
Description: Recognizing the importance of function prototypes in modular
programming and learning how to declare and use them.
Highlight: Skill in declaring and utilizing function prototypes for modular code
design.

Variable Scope
Description: Understanding variable scope and where variables are accessible
within a program.
Highlight: Insights into variable scope for maintaining data integrity and
preventing naming conflicts.

GCC Flags
Description: Learning essential GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) flags, such as
-Wall, -Werror, -pedantic, -Wextra, and -std=gnu89.
Highlight: Expertise in compiler flags for code quality improvement and
adherence to standards.

Header Files
Description: Mastering use of header files with #include to incorporate external
code and declarations.
Highlight: Proficiency in including external code to enhance program
functionality and reusability.

This project aims to showcase my growth and competence in these fundamental
aspects of C programming. Stay tuned for updates on my journey to becoming a
proficient C programmer!
